/**
 * Provides the Objectos {@link java.util.Set} implementations and utilities.
 *
 * <p>
 * The primary goal of this package is to provide a single and unified
 * {@link java.util.Set} API that, ideally, should behave and perform
 * uniformly across multiple Java releases. In particular, it is to provide an
 * API for the Objectos libraries themselves, as they must suport multiple Java
 * releases.
 *
 * <p>
 * A corollary of the former is that it is a non-goal to provide better or
 * or smarter {@link java.util.Set} implementations over the ones from the Java
 * Collections Framework.
 *
 * <p>
 * A secondary goal is to provide a small and concise {@link java.util.Set} API
 * while, at the same time, it should not get in the way of the Objectos
 * programmer.
 *
 * <p>
 * A corollary of the former is that it is a non-goal to satisfy every possible
 * use-case that should arise.
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementations provided by this package are not general-purpose
 * implementations:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>they do not permit {@code null} values;</li>
 * <li>some operations specified by {@link java.util.Collection} or by
 * {@link java.util.Set} may not be supported;</li>
 * <li>other operations specified by {@link java.util.Collection} or by
 * {@link java.util.Set} may not be implemented;</li>
 * <li>iterators produced by the classes in this package are NOT<i>fail-fast</i>
 * as defined by {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException}; and</li>
 * <li>classes do not implement hash-collision attack mitigations as
 * {@link java.util.HashSet} as {@link java.util.LinkedHashSet} have been
 * implementing since Java 8.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Null Pointers</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw a
 * {@link NullPointerException} if given a {@code null} argument.
