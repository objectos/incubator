= The `Equals` class

The `Equals` is a utility class for implementing `Object.equals(Object)` methods.
It offers methods for testing pairs of objects for equality in a null-safe manner.

== Single attribute

[,java]
----
class Category {
  String name;

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    return o == this || o instanceof Category that
      && Equals.of(name, that.name);
  }
}
----

== Two or more attributes

When testing two attributes for equality:

[,java]
----
class Product {
  String name;
  Brand brand;

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    return o == this || o instanceof Product that
      && Equals.of(
        name, that.name,
        brand, that.brand
      );
  }
}
----

When testing three attributes:

[,java]
----
class Edition {
  Book book;
  Publisher publisher;
  LocalDate date;

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    return o == this || o instanceof Edition that
      && Equals.of(
        book, that.book,
        publisher, that.publisher,
        date, that.date
      );
  }
}
----

== Primitives

The methods provided by the `Equals` class are suited for object references.
You should avoid using it when testing primitive values for equality.
You should use the `==` operator instead:

[,java]
----
class ShoppingCartItem {
  ShoppingCart cart;
  Product product;
  int quantity;

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    return o == this || o instanceof ShoppingCartItem that
      && quantity == that.quantity
      && Equals.of(
        cart, that.cart,
        product, that.product
      );
  }
}
