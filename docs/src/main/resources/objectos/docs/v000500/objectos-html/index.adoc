= Objectos HTML
:toc-title: Overview

_This API is experimental and might change substantially between releases_

Objectos HTML is a library for generating HTML using pure Java.

It introduces the concept of a "pure Java template";
it feels similar to a traditional text-based template except it is a regular Java class.

== Alpha quality

Please note that Objectos HTML is a work in progress and this release is marked as alpha quality.

Additionally, this documentation is also a work in progress.
