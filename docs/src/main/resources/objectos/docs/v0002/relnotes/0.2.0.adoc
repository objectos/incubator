= Objectos 0.2.0 release notes

_June 13, 2022_

Welcome to Objectos 0.2.0, the second public release of the
Objectos suite of Java libraries.

== JDK compatibility

Objectos 0.2.0 requires JDK 17 or later.

== What's new in Objectos 0.2.0

This release introduces the ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/index[Objectos Lang] library.
It provides:

* a set of utilities for objects whose type is from the `java.lang` package; and
* a note sink API

=== The `Check` class

The ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/Check[`Check`] class
helps verify if a method or constructor has been invoked correctly:

[,java]
----
public void start(String name, int value) {
  Check.notNull(name, "name == null");
  Check.argument(value > 0, "value must be positive");
  Check.state(this.state == State.NEW, "cannot start: already started");
}
----

If any of the check conditions
does not evaluate to `true` then the check fails with a specific `RuntimeException` sub-type.

You can find ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/Check[the full documentation here].

=== Utilities for overriding `java.lang.Object` methods

Objectos Lang provides three utilities each for overriding one of the following
`java.lang.Object` method:

* ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/Equals[`equals`]
* ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/HashCode[`hashCode`]
* ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/ToString[`toString`]

The following example show all of them in action:

[,java]
----
class Edition implements ToString.Formattable {
  Book book;
  Publisher publisher;
  LocalDate date;

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    return o == this || o instanceof Edition that
      && Equals.of(
        book, that.book,
        publisher, that.publisher,
        date, that.date
      );
  }

  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    return HashCode.of(book, publisher, date);
  }

  @Override
  public void formatToString(StringBuilder sb, int level) {
    ToString.format(
      sb, level, this,
      "book", book,
      "publisher", publisher,
      "date", date
    );
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return ToString.of(this);
  }
}
----

You can find the full documentation for each of the classes in the links below:

* ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/Equals[`Equals`]
* ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/HashCode[`HashCode`]
* ilink:v0002/objectos-lang/ToString[`ToString`]

=== The note sink API

Objectos Lang provides an API for defining and sending notes about events taking
place during an application execution. Use it for logging or debugging.

[,java]
----
import objectos.lang.*;

public class Service {
  static final Note1<String> SAY_HELLO = Note1.info();

  private final NoteSink sink;

  Service(NoteSink sink) { this.sink = sink; }

  public void sayHelloWorld() {
    sink.send(SAY_HELLO, "world!");
  }
}
----
