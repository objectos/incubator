= Getting started with Objectos Logging

Welcome to Objectos Logging.

This chapter introduces you to logging libraries in general and to
Objectos Logging in particular.

We begin by explaining why you may require a logging library in your Java application.
Next we give an overview on the Objectos Logging approach to logging. Finally we
give you instructions on how to install Objectos Logging and how to quickly get some
working Java code that makes use of Objectos Logging.
