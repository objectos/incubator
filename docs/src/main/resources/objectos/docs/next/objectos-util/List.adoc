= Lists

Objectos Utils provides two special-purpose array-backed `java.util.List` implementations:

- `objectos.util.GrowableList`: a mutable grow-only implementation; and
- `objectos.util.UnmodifiableList`: an unmodifiable implementation. 

The primary use-case is to use the former as a builder of the latter.
