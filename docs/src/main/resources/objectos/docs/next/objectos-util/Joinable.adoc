= Concatenating all of the elements into a string

The `BaseCollection` provides three `join` methods that returns a `String`.
They are:

- `join()`
- `join(String delimiter)`
- `join(String delimiter, String prefix, String suffix)`

They are for creating a string representation of the elements of a collection by joining all of the elements together.

They are similar in functionality to the `joining` methods provided by the JDK `Collectors` class.
As a design choice, the order of their parameters are also the same.
