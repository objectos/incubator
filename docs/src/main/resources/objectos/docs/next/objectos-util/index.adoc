= Objectos Util
:toc-title: Overview

Objectos Util is a Java library that provides:

* a special-purpose collections API; and
* utility classes for operating on arrays of primitive values and arrays of object references.

The primary goal of Objectos Util is to provide a collections API for the Objectos libraries themselves.

You are welcome to use Objectos Util in your projects.
Bear in mind though that implementations are special-purpose.
In other words, _this is not a general-purpose collections library_.
